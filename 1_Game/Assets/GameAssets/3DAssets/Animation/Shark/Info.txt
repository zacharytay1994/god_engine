Subdivision 0 = 3171 Polygons & 2238 verts
Subdivision 1 = 6797 polygons & 6919 verts
Render sub = 25301 Polygons & 25533 verts

Model have just square polygons/faces - No triss
and got good typology, so its easy to add just triss to all polygons if needed.


All parts of model is Uv -mapped with 2 textures =
Sharktexture002.png = 6100*6100 (Bodytexture)
Sharkmouthtexture002.png = 2600*2600
.These textures is of course included in the file that you download.

Animation frames.
Swim 10-50
Attack 50-102
Idle 105-170
You can also use Idle-frames for swim in very low speed.
The idle animation is not shown as Turntable, but im sure you will not be disappointed.
Frame 10-50 is a very aggresive fast swimming action.

The model is, as you already know = RIGGED - So why dont you make your own cool animation?! ;)
The shark is perfectly rigged for any movement.

This shark is 100% my own design using my own sketch/blueprint.
